## Download

### [⬇ Download egPDF for Windows](https://github.com/acc-studio/egpdf/releases/latest/download/egPDF-Setup.exe)

One-click installer, per-user, no admin rights needed. All versions are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/acc-studio/egpdf/releases).

> The installer is not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may show a warning —
> choose **More info → Run anyway**, or build from source below.

## Viewing

- **Tabs** — open many PDFs (drag & drop anywhere, `Ctrl+O`, middle-click a tab to close, `Ctrl+Tab` to switch).
- **Clean viewer** — continuous scroll, fit-width, zoom (`Ctrl`+wheel / `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0`), text selection, search (`Ctrl+F`).
- **Split view** — the split button shows two documents side by side; click a pane to focus it, then pick a tab for it.
- **Compare** — with two documents in split view, the compare button diffs their text word-by-word; click a difference to jump both panes to it.
- **Pages panel** — the sidebar button shows page thumbnails: drag to reorder, hover a page to rotate 90° or delete it. `Ctrl+Z` undoes page changes.
- **Text selection** — select text with the mouse to copy it, or use the popup that appears: **Highlight**, **Edit text** (whites out the selection and opens a pre-filled, size-matched text box to retype), or **Redact**.
- **Print (Ctrl+P)** — opens an M365-style print screen: settings panel (printer, copies, page range, one/two-sided, collation, orientation, paper size, color, fit/actual size) beside a live page preview with navigation and zoom. Prints the document exactly as saving would produce it: form values, highlights, comments, added text/images, and true redactions all included (pages rendered at 150 dpi through the save pipeline).

## Editing (applied on Save)

- **Redact (R)** — drag a box; on save the page is re-rendered to an image with the box burned in, so the underlying text is *actually removed* from the file.
- **Whiteout (W)** — cover an area with white.
- **Highlight (H)** — translucent yellow marker.
- **Text (T)** — click to add text. Font and size dropdowns appear in the toolbar (native Windows fonts: Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman, Segoe UI, Verdana, …); the chosen font is embedded (subset) into the PDF on save, Unicode included. Double-click to re-edit.
- **Image (I)** — insert PNG/JPEG, drag to move, corner handle to resize.
- **Comment (C)** — click to attach a sticky-note; saved as a real PDF annotation visible in any viewer.
- **Select (V)** — move/resize/delete edits (`Del`), undo (`Ctrl+Z`).
- **PDF forms** — fillable text boxes and checkboxes render as native inputs; values are written back into the file on save.

Save with `Ctrl+S`, Save As with `Ctrl+Shift+S`; dirty tabs show a `•`.
